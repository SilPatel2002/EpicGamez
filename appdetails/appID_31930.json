It\u2019s a solid game effort by Her Interactive and those who might have been passing on the Nancy Drew series might just want to give this one a try. In my opinion, The White Wolf of Icicle Creek is an excellent step in the right direction.\u201d<br />\r\nJust Adventure<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\u201cSuitable for all ages, the game also contains some educational tidbits on wildlife and brain-teasing puzzles that may make it a good choice for children and families, though prospective buyers may want to note that there are some characters that fall into possibly offensive racial stereotypes. In any case, though, it\u2019s a decent adventure game, and fans of the series will probably find it worthwhile to take a look.\u201d<br />\r\nGame Chronicles<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\u201cAt the end of the day, Nancy Drew: The White Wolf of Icicle Creek is everything we have come to expect from this series of games. It has nicely enmeshed puzzles peppered throughout the game, a number of quirky characters to interact with and a solidly written dialogue.\u201d<br />\r\nAdventure Gamers<br />\r\n", "header_image": "https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/31930/header.jpg?t=1734468527", "capsule_image": "https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/31930/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1734468527", "capsule_imagev5": "https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/31930/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1734468527", "website": "https://www.herinteractive.com/shop-games/nancy-drew-the-white-wolf-of-icicle-creek/", "pc_requirements": {"minimum": "<ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS *:</strong> Window XP/Vista<br>\t                </li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> 1 GHz or greater Pentium or equivalent class CPU<br>\t                </li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 128 MB of RAM<br>\t                </li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> 32 MB DirectX 9.0 compatible video card<br>\t                </li><li><strong>DirectX:</strong> 9.0<br>\t                </li><li><strong>Hard Drive:</strong> 1 GB or more of hard drive space<br>\t                </li><li><strong>Sound:</strong> 16 bit DirectX compatible sound card<br>                </li></ul>"}, "mac_requirements": [], "linux_requirements": [], "legal_notice": "Copyright \u00a9 2008 Her Interactive, Inc.
