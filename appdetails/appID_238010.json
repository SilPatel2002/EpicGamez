Human Revolution would bear replaying even without the enhancements \u2014 it's a rare title that combines superb world building and storytelling with such dedication to player choice. I lost myself in the world of Human Revolution, and relished every opportunity to dive deeper into its mysteries.\u201d<br>9/10 \u2013 Polygon<br><br>\u201cWith a story that lasts hours on end, additional DLC that will keep you challenged throughout (wait till you get to Missing Link), unbeatable touch-screen implementation and a majority of the same great stuff from the original release, the Director's Cut of Deus Ex: Human Revolution definitely deserves a look. This is how the game was meant to be played, especially on the Wii U, even with its wide control set-up.
