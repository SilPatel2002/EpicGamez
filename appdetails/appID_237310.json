This Second Path has complete mastery over the celestial power of the stars to both lend aid to his allies and devastation to his enemies.<br> <br>Check out the Noah Second Path Teaser Trailer Video here: <br> <br>As Celestia, Noah overcomes his desire for revenge and accepts the tutelage of Clamor, a former elven scholar who is Noah\u2019s close friend. Through his increasing knowledge of Magic, Noah concentrates his studies on the great flow of the sun, moon, celestial bodies and the power of time within himself. He becomes the \u201cObserver of the Constellations\u201d travelling between the memories of the cosmos and the present. <br> <br>Celestia wields both the Sickle and Magical Cards as his primary weapons, which allows him to harness the power of constellations.

This allows Celestia to support his allies through healing and buffs, while also allowing him to rain down meteorites, stars and even planets upon his enemies. But be cautious as the entropic nature of Space may be difficult to control leading to side-effects - both good and bad. <br> <br>During the period of Celestia\u2019s Launch, Elsword will be celebrating the Noah 2nd Path Update Event which is specially designed to help jumpstart your Celestia with rewards like 50% EXP Boost Medal, Consumable Potions, Mounts and more!
