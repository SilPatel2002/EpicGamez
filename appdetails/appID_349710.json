This is three minutes of increasingly difficult enemies spawns and swarms with one objective; to turn you into dust.

This is the arcade mode you grew up with and love, so post those high scores and show the world you are the Shwip master. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">  </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Style</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Complete a series of objectives based on weapon and ability combinations to unlock your ship's turbo mode. Once you reach maximum power, you can unleash an onslaught of turbo powered weaponry and abilities. Every time you activate turbo the difficulty increases, but so does the multiplier.
