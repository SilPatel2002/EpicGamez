We are proud that community approved our project and allowed us to be in Steam. Thanks you very much!</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>Celestial Command is a realistic co-op crafting survival sandbox space game which unites an orbital mechanics, realistic physics, ship constructor and various features of classic space games.<br><br>Mine asteroids, salvage space debris, build space ships and stations, manage fuel and energy, trade goods, performs missions and fight against enemies in large open world with realistic 2D physics based on orbital mechanics or in alternative, more classic game mode.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Realistic Orbital Mechanic</h2><br>The world of the game works based on simplified orbital mechanics. Everything in state of constant orbital motion. Perform orbital maneuvers and keep your space ships on stable orbits to prevent crashing on a planet or loosing ship in deep space.<br>The physics simulates in 2D space, this makes flying and navigation enjoyable and easy but also generates a lot of interesting situations due physical collisions which are more often in 2D space than in 3D.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/330460/extras/Orbit-Fixed.gif?t=1699181351\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Galaxy</h2><br>Explore a procedural galaxy filled with various types of stars, black holes, planets, asteroids, space stations and other interesting things which we will constantly add in the future.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/330460/extras/eKu5aAe[1].gif?t=1699181351\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Fully Customizable Ships and Space stations</h2><br>You can build your own ship part by part.
